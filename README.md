## Getting Started

If you want to get started locally, you can clone the project, install the dependencies and run the dev command!

```
git clone https://github.com/netlify-templates/solid-quickstart.git
cd solid-quickstart
npm install
npm run dev
# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles Solid in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Deploying using the Netlify CLI

- Install the Netlify CLI globally `npm install netlify-cli -g`
    
- Run `npm run build`

- Then use the `netlify deploy` for a deploy preview link or `netlify deploy --prod` to deploy to production

Here are a few other ways you can deploy this template:
    
- Use the Netlify CLI's create from template command `netlify sites:create-template solid-quickstart` which will create a repo, Netlify project, and deploy it
    
- If you want to utilize continuous deployment through GitHub webhooks, run the Netlify command `netlify init` to create a new project based on your repo or `netlify link` to connect your repo to an existing project
